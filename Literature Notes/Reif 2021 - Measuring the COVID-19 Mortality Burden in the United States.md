# Key Points

> What are they key takeaways from this literature

- Using excess deaths alone as a measure of the impact of the pandemic underestimates the impact on younger populations when taking into account the Years of Life Lost and loss of Quality Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs).
- The YLLs estimated in the individualised risk computation were much closer to the average risk estimates than to frailty-based risk estimates, suggesting that the pandemic tends to target people with closer-to-average life expectancy for their subgroup.

# Motivation

> Why was this literature written what problem is it addressing?

- This study attempted to measure the Years of Life Lost (YLLs) and Quality-adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost from the COVID-19 pandemic by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity in the United States for people aged 25 years and older.
- Excess deaths have been used most often to mesaure the mortality burden of the pandemic, but this does not readily translate into YLLs or QALYs, and due to the fact that COVID-19 deaths have generally been concentrated amongst older adults then using this statistic can understimate the impact on younger populations. 
- Having a clearer view of the mortality burden amongst different demographics enables the identification of particularly vulnerable populations, and helps to evaluate pandemic mitigation measures.

# Methods

> What methods were used? How do they address any issues?

- The study uses the Future Elderly Model (FEM) and Future Adult Model (FAM) microsimulation models, to project what life expectancy would have been for a nationally representative cohort of Americans aged 25 years or older if the pandemic had never happened. They identified cohort member who most closely resembled people who died due the pandemic (these people were identified from CDC data on excess deaths) and summed their total life-years and QALYs from the projection.
- The study uses three different analytic approaches to risk in the simulation. The first "average risk" analysis assigns equal risk of death to all individuals within a sub-group defined by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. The second "individualised risk" allowed for risk to vary with individual characteristics, health status, and COVID-19 risk factors (such as obesity, smoking status) within a sub-group. The third "frailty-based risk" presumed that the pandemic selectively targeted those with the highest projected risk for death in each sub-group and serves as the lower bound for the YLL estimates.
- Individualised risk is the authors preferred analytic approach.
- The FAM and FEM are based on the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamic (PSID) respectively.
- Quality of life is measured using the EuroQol 5-dimension questionnaire, and imputed in the HRS and PSID using variables in common with the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (methods in supplemental document).


# Results

> What was the outcome of the research? Was it successful?

- The mortality burden of the pandemic (YLLs and QALYs) were estimated for age, sex, and race/ethnicity alone, both total and per 10,000 of the population. The mortality burden was then also estimated when taking into account the underlying risk factors for COVID-19 mortality.
- Despite the excess risk of death being higher in the older (65+) population than the younger (25-64), the difference in QALYs and YLLs was much smaller, suggesting that using the excess deaths statistic alone underestimates the burden of the pandemic on younger age groups.
- The greatest toll of the pandemic was on Black and Hispanic communities, especially in those 65 or older. 
- Biggest risk factors for mortality from COVID-19 in the US were
	1. Dementia
	2. Living in a nursing home
	3. History of stroke
	4. Morbid obesity (BMI > 40)
