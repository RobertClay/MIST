# What is an Evergreen Note?

Evergreen notes encapsulate a single concept idea drawn from literature notes. They are a summary that feeds into your own writing. They should follow 5 key rules:
1. They should be atomic. They should be about one topic only. They should encapsulate as much of that topic as possible.
2. They should be concept orientated rather than book, author, project etc.
3. They should be densely linked. Using as many double brackets and hashtags as possible to tie notes together. 
4. They should be organised in as flat a hierarchy as possible. Using many tiers of folders does not help.
5. They should be written for the author's (or a specialist audience's) understanding and not the public. More general prose is suitable in a public_note.
