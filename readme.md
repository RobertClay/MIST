# Microsimulation Techniques Literature Vault 

This repository contains the obsidian vault for microsimulation work within the Leeds Institute for Data Analytics. It is designed to be a collaborative accumulation of literature to facilitate ideas about microsimualtion.

# Slipboxes
(I'd start here https://takesmartnotes.com/. They explain it better.)

The idea of a slipbox (or zettelkasten) is to organise ideas in flat hierarchy where they are easily visible and linkable. As notes and the links between them increase it allows the user to easily ask questions of their notes, search for weaknesses in them, and ultimately establish a framework for a piece of literature. This framework can then be edited into print as necessary.

It is not designed to be a place to dump as much literature as possible. The internet does that very well already. Rather additions should come under three categories:

- fleeting notes. These are simply rough ideas. Anything you come up with that requires further thought. In a public vault like this they are not as useful. I'd suggest keeping them to your own vaults or something like a trello. See the [[fleeting_note]] template.
- literature notes. These are summaries of piece of literature. They take ideas by author or project. They should not be copied directly but your own personal interpretation of the notes. How to write these notes is subjective but we are using a template given in [[literature_note]]. This asks for key findings, motivation, methods, and results. (see not finished example)
- permanent/evergreen notes. These summarising notes should be focused around singular concepts rather than authors/papers/etc. These should again follow the style guide in [[evergreen_note]]. 

# Links

Just having a big box of notes doesn't really help either. These notes must be linked together as extensively as possible. There are two main ways to do this. First is hashtags. Simply including a soft tag such as #mircrosimulation ties a note to all notes with this tag. Using a hard tag such as [[evergreen_note]] directly links one note to another. Again use both as copiously as possible.

# Activating Templates

Note to use the above templates you must activate templates within your own obsidian vault. To this there are two steps:
1. Go to settings-> Core Plugins -> Templates -> Insert template content from a folder of template files. This allows for use of templates
2. Go to settings ->Plugin Options -> Templates and specify the template folder location as utility/templates. This is so it can find the templates.
